The SendRoutingInfo message is considered to be a catgeory 1 messages as categorized by the GSMA. Meaning that this message must
filtered on the interconnects parameter its only allowed to be used in the core.

The normal usage scenario for this message, upon receiving an ISUP message from the roaming partner to the home network's GMSC, 
the GMSC sends an SRI message to the HLR, to identify the location of subsriber to terminate the incoming call to the subscriber

The returned infromation from HLR could be the following
  1- Cell ID of user
  2- MSC/VLR the user is attached to
  3- IMSI
  4- GPS location
  5- IMEI
  and more..

The MSISDN is the only parameter required to run this attack. It also could be used to probe the network as your destination will be the 
MSISDN, but the response will be coming from HLR that the target is assigned to :)
