The SendRoutingInfo For SM is the main message use before sending an SMS, as with calls , when terminating the SMS the sending SMSC must
know the location of the subscriber, thus the message is sent to the home network HLR and the HLR will response with the below
info:
  - MSC/VLR GT
  - IMSI
  - IMEI
  -CellID
  ..much more
Thus its criticaly important for operators to check the number of send SRISM messages to the number of actually MT_Forward_SM message
that finishes the SMS sending sequence and submits the SMS data to the subscriber

You only need the MSISDN to send a SRISM
